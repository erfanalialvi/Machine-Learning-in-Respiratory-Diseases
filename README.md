# Machine-Learning-in-Respiratory-Diseases
The purpose of this project is to show how machine learning, specifically sound classification, can be used to detect respiratory diseases, mainly COVID-19 from audio recognition of coughs and Heart sounds.
The audio classification can help reduce time and diagnose a diverse range of respiratory conditions, especially now with an ability to provide a potential widespread COVID-19 screening
